# Secret as cloud-init user data

Store userdata in a file that populates a secret.
Use this secret as user data for cloud-init.

Using a jsonpatch allows for replacment of cloudInitNoData volume without deleting the rootdisk volume.

Disable the hash suffix in the Kustomize secretGenerator, because the patch is buried in a string object you must have a determinant name for the secretref.
