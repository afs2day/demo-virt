= Network Settings as Kustomize Components

Use the link:../../../templates[templates] to generate network configs and commit the rendered manifests for application with Kustomize.

Do not apply these directly, but reference them as components in your overlay kustomization.yaml. Eg link:../../demos/rhel-box/[rhel-box]

The link:br-vmdata[br-vmdata] should be used once to configure the bridge at the cluster level.

All other VLANs are attached to this bridge at a namespace level.
